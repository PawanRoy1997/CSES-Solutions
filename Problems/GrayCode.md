#### Time limit : 1.0s
#### Memory limit : 512MB

## Task
Gray Code is a list of all 2^n bit strings of length n, where any two successive string differ exactly one bit (i.e, 
their hamming distance is one).
## Input
The only input line has an integer n.

## Output
Print 2^n lines that describe the Gray Code. You can print any valid solution.

## Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 16

## Example
