# Weird Algorithm
#### Time limit : 1.0s
#### Memory limit : 512MB

## Task
Consider an algorithm that takes a positive integer n as input. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n
is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three an adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one.
For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:

    3 ⟶ 10 ⟶ 5 ⟶ 16 ⟶ 8 ⟶ 4 ⟶ 2 ⟶ 1 

## Input
The only input line contains an integer n.
## Output
Print a line contains all the values of n during the algorithm.

## Constraints
- 1 <= xi <= 10^9

## Example
#### Input:
3
#### Output:
3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
